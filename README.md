> OS => SP * BP * MP => SE

Our vision is **To co-create and participate in _the common wealth creation_** so we invest in educational program and sustainable societies to start with.

UP20 members concentrate efforts promoting _the ability of the commons_ for capacity building to florish and thrive upon _the common ability_ to improve access and literacy, as well as, _all resources neccessary_ for **common wealth creation** and by that - to promote the source of well-being. 
Our premise is based on vast experience and research suggesting that ALL wealth is created by the commons.

WE find great Social Projects (Sp) and learn about their Best Practice (Bp) and share them in the Market-Place (Mp) which is designed specifically for enterpreneurs, social activists and organizations.
