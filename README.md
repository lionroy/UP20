# UP20
**UP20 | Universal Projects _Twenty_**
is an open-source social project best-practice marketplace for everyone. 

Here's a simple mnemonic formula to describe our values: 
`Open Source Software => 
     Value(Social Programs * 
     Best-Practices * 
     Monitoring * 
     Public Relations) = Shared Value` 

which in many words stands for-
> UP20 is a SHARED MARKET PLACE for civil society organizations, social enterprises & community engagement

## Our Vision
Our vision is to become leaders of co-creation and participation by promoting **_the common wealth creation_**. By drawing upon the common wealth of ideas we act to promote more social interactions and in effect to increase _The Social Surplus of our global network_, and that's why we invest in educational programs who promote sustainablity and civil society networks to start with. 

### What do we do?
WE find great Social Projects (Sp) and learn about their Best Practice (Bp) and share them in the Market-Place (Mp) which is designed specifically for enterpreneurs, social activists and organizations.

### Who are we?
UP20 members concentrate efforts promoting _the ability of the commons_ for capacity building to florish and thrive upon _the common ability_ to generate wealth and creativity. 

To improve access and literacy, as well as, _all resources neccessary_ for **common wealth creation** and by that - to promote the source of well-being. 
Our premise is based on vast experience and research suggesting that ALL wealth is created by the commons.

 Our members, partners and affiliates reach-out to collaborate with like-minded professionals from all walks of life including - eager entrepreneurs, top-notch managers, brilliant consultants and tech-savvy developers in companies, organizations and in fact we are all social activists.
