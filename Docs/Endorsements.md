We are amazed at the reach of social programs all aound the globe today. Both in terms of quality as well as quantity, we find useful materials is being shared freely. Some of the content is affiliated with organizations - educational, municipal, government, or companies. Other stuff is being generated by self expressive individuals and communities.
The purpose of this list is to expose and endorse social programs _you can surely learn, use, adapt, develop and build upon_.
