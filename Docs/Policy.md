## Minding The Gap | 
#### Building bridges to increase access and reduce the digital and social divide.

The digital gap is a common term which hides more than it reveals abot its very essence.
To start, it's not a gap, like the one between your platform and the train, which is roughly 20-30 centimeters wide. It's HUGE.
The gap we're talking abot is perhaps the most challenging objectives as described by researchers and policy makers.

### One important thing we noted 'the gap is universal'. 

##### What do we mean?
  
When you consider the nature of gaps, such as generational gaps, educational gaps or access to technilogy, 
  you may realize the gap is naturally growing even in case you may mitigate its effect:
*  consider AGE, GENDER, RACE, CULTURE, MONEY...  gaps exist
*  consider OPPERTUNITY, STRENGTH, WEAKNESS, THREAT... gaps exist
*  consider TRANSPORT, ARCHITECHTURE, INVESTMENTS, CREDIT...  gaps exist
*  consider BANKING, BUSINESS, CORPORATIONS, COMPANIES, GOVERNMENTS...  gaps exist
*  consider EDUCATION, HUMAN RIGHTS, SOCIAL ACCESS, COMMUNITY, CAPACITY...  gaps exist
*  consider WEALTH, HEALTH, WELL-BEING and still the gaps exist.   
    
 ##### What's universal about it?
  A. there's always a gap
  B. gaps tend to grow
  C. experience proves we can mitigate certain gaps with certain activities.

For instance - Educational programs that increase sanitation to reduce disease;
 - Economical programs that lend small amounts to create business opportunities;
 - Open-Source projects (programs too) that facilitate access to deprived countries;
 - Open-Source project for everyone. Individuals and Corporations alike - this, mitigating ACCESS TECHNOLOGY. 
   etc.
    
**this means we have to take smarter decisions to mitigate the growing gaps always and everywhere.**
    
### Let's try to put this in layers:
--- The list is yet to be prioritized

The gap is defined by one or more of the following access-abilities
  1. Access to Resources
  1. Access to Language
  1. Access to Knowledge, Information and Data
  1. Access to Education, school and extracurricular activities
  1. Access to Technology, Platforms, Computers and Code abilities
  1. Access to Architechture, Planning and Construction
  1. Access to Policy and Decision Making
  1. Access Economy, Money and Wealth Creation

In terms of society there are Sectors where the gap exists. Note that these are our natural strategic allies,
We seek to engage with organizations that provide solutions for these issues:
*  Access Communities
*  Access Culture
*  Access Authority (Government, Municipal, Organizations)
*  Access Business
*  Access Information Sources and Process Power
*  Access Culture, Creativity and Art
